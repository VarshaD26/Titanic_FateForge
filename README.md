Titanic Survival Intelligence Platform

It's an end-to-end, Machine Learning system that predicts passenger survival during the RMS Titanic disaster using historical data, advanced ML models, interactive dashboards, and real-time streaming.

Project Objective: To develop a robust survival prediction system that:
1. Predicts whether a passenger survived or not
2. Uses passenger attributes such as:
    i. Age
    ii. Gender
    iii. Passenger class
    iv. Fare
    v. Family size
3. Allows customized filtering & sorting of predictions
4. Supports:
    i. Batch predictions
    ii. Individual predictions
    iii. Real-time Kafka streaming

Project Highlights
1. Advanced Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
2. Feature engineering (family size, titles, encoded variables)
3. Interactive Streamlit Dashboard (KPIs, filtering, sorting)
4. Batch & individual predictions
5. Real-time predictions using Kafka
6. Scalable & container-ready architecture
7. Clean UI

    c. One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
3. Models Trained
    a.Logistic Regression
    b.Random Forest (Best Performer)
    c.Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
    d.Cross-validation for generalization
